## [The LeetCode Phenomenon](https://medium.com/swlh/the-leetcode-phenomena-e9ec4de41ca)

I found this article interesting because it tackles a very prominent phenomeneon that is present in the CS community today -- Leetcode. Since its birth in 2015, this online coding platform has proliferated the software engineering field making itself a staple of technical interview preparation. Whether that is a good thing or not is to be debated. Some believe that it is a great equalizer for interviewing candidates from different backgrounds. On the other hand, many believe that it is a completely unnecessary and tedious task that has no place in every day work of a software engineer. This is a debate that I am not interested in, but also experiencing right now.

### nedjulius comment:

I mainly agree with the article. I think that the CS interview preparation nowadays is more about the specific problem than the actual concepts that will be used in the office environment. Leetcode offers an opportunity to explore different engineering concepts and algorithms, but it's a lot easier albeit not necessarily more effective to memorize the solutions.
