## The LeetCode Phenomenon
(https://medium.com/swlh/the-leetcode-phenomena-e9ec4de41ca)

I found this article interesting because it tackles a very prominent phenomeneon that is present in the CS community today -- Leetcode. Since its birth in 2015, this online coding platform has proliferated the software engineering field making itself a staple of technical interview preparation. Whether that is a good thing or not is to be debated. Some believe that it is a great equalizer for interviewing candidates from different backgrounds. On the other hand, many believe that it is a completely unnecessary and tedious task that has no place in every day work of a software engineer. This is a debate that I am not interested in, but also experiencing right now.

### nedjulius comment:
I mainly agree with the article. I think that the CS interview preparation nowadays is more about the specific problem than the actual concepts that will be used in the office environment. Leetcode offers an opportunity to explore different engineering concepts and algorithms, but it's a lot easier albeit not necessarily more effective to memorize the solutions.

### Additional thoughts by Thomas Huang (thomashuang02): 
I find it interesting that the "cheating mode" (wherein applicants find interview questions already online and solve them beforehand) raises the bar of interviews, and that some companies are consciously combating and addressing or circumventing the LeetCode issue. Nevertheless, I've only recently begun LeetCoding and have wished I started earlier; developing brain-muscle memory, whether it be for certain breeds of algorithms or for the syntax of several coding languages, is something that will benefit me in the short- and long-run.

I found it that it is interesting to see if you are trying to solve 1000 problems on leetcode, it would take approximately 2 years to do that. Because I am planning on doing 3 problems for a day, and I realize that it would take me 4.5 hours. Also I never thought that leetcode would be considered as a "cheating". I love this app since it provides me with various of practice and I believe that without these practicing I would never be this proficient with algorithm.
